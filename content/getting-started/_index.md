These pages show you how to get started using the Platen module for Hugo to author interactive digital books.

[Hugo][01] is a tool for quickly creating static websites you can deploy anywhere. Static sites don't require setting
up servers. Sites built with Hugo are fast, secure by default, and enable you to write your content in plain text
without needing to learn HTML.

Platen builds on Hugo, providing you with a set of tools that give you a clean and minimal theme you can fully
customize, extend Markdown for interactive books, and simplify your workflow. With Platen, you can write your books
once and then release them as web pages, EPUBs, and PDFs.

When you decide you're ready to try using Platen to publish interactive digital books, you have a few different
options. These pages describe those options and walk you through going from nothing to a published site of your own.

If you want to jump right in and get your site up and running in the next half-hour, you should follow the
[Happy Path][01] tutorial. If you've got experience working with static site generators generally or Hugo specifically,
you might prefer to follow the [Manual Path][02] tutorial.

Once you've got a site up and running, you might want to read the rest of this guide to see what else you can do with
Platen. Alternatively, you can jump right into the [user][03] or [theme][04] guides instead.
