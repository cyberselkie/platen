When you want to create your Platen site, you have two broad options.

1. You can [create your site from the provided template][01], which mirrors the [happy path][02] to some extent. We
   strongly recommend this approach for its simplicity.
1. You can [create your site from scratch][03] using Hugo and add your own file structure. We recommend this approach
   only if you're already familiar with Platen and Hugo and want to create a site structure that differs strongly from
   the provided template.

[01]: ./from-template.md
[02]: ../../happy-path-setup/index.md
[03]: from-scratch.md
