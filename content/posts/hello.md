For years now, analog tabletop games have been getting digital and physical releases. Unfortunately,
the typical digital release format has been the same PDF the team used to print the book. This often
means it's not very accessible, missing alt text and mis-ordered, and nearly always means it's
non-interactive.

There's a better format for books meant to be read on screens. One that is deeply interactive, that
is responsive to the devices being used to read it, that is able to cross-reference itself and other
texts, and that can be made extremely accessible. That format is, unsurprisingly, a web page. If
you're not reading a physical printout of this post on a screen, you're reading a web page.

This project, Platen, is a toolkit that helps make the development experience for indie tabletop
game developers---and anyone else who wants to make interactive digital texts---as delightful as
possible. One of the largest barriers to this process has been the skills and domain expertise
required for creating an accessible, beautiful, and extensively interactive site.

Platen limits the necessary work and expertise. Of course, it can't _eliminate_ the need for
familiarity and there's no actual magical solution to obviate all work, but it does make the process
simpler, clearer, and more more manageable for folks who don't know their way around web
development.

For those that _do_, Platen also provides a good foundational toolkit geared directly at tabletop
gaming texts that they can build on top of.

We're excited to continually iterate on this project and smooth out the experience as much as
possible. Talk to you soon!
