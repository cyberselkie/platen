  This line of Markdown is very long. It might not be aesthetically pleasing to
  have a subscript with this much text.

  Notice that this does produce two paragraphs of text for the subscript because
  Platen keeps the line breaks. The blank line between these paragraphs ensures
  they're actually rendered as paragraphs.
