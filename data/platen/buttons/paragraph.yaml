  This block of Markdown is much longer than you could typically fit into a
  button. It might not be aesthetically pleasing to have a button with this
  much text.

  Notice that this does produce two paragraphs of text for the button because
  Platen keeps the line breaks. The blank line between these paragraphs ensures
  they're actually rendered as paragraphs.
