    The Toroidal module makes it simpler to host webrings from a static site built with Hugo. These
    settings and options control how the Toroidal module behaves at the site level.
type: object
properties:
  WebringName:
    title: Webring Name
    description: Specifies the name of the webring to host
    schematize:
      weight: 1
      details: |
        If this value is specified, it's used as the default name for webrings on the site. This
        value is most useful if you're creating your webring in the `content/toroidal` folder and
        don't want to add an `_index.md` file.

        If you're hosting multiple webrings on the same site, every webring except one will need to
        define a section page (`_index.md`) and override this value with `ToroidalWebringName` in
        the front matter.

        This value can also be overridden on a per member basis with `ToroidalWebringName` in the
        member page's front matter.
    type: string
  RandomMemberLink:
    title: Random Member Link
    description: Specifies whether to include a link to a random member in the ring navigation
    schematize:
      weight: 2
      details: |
        This value specifies whether the generated navigation for webring members should include a
        link to a random member of the webring. If this value is set to `false`, the link isn't
        included. If this value is set to `true`, the link is included. The default is `true`.

        The implementation of the random member link ensures visitors of member sites not using an
        iframe for their webring navigation to visit a random member of the webring, even when
        connectivity to the webring host isn't available. In that case, the navigation uses a
        pre-defined list of available members from when the member site's administrator copied the
        HTML snippet.

        When there's connectivity to the webring host, the random member link instead calls the
        host's API for the most up-to-date list of members and randomly selects one.

        This value can be overridden at the webring level by defining `ToroidalRandomMemberLink` in
        the front matter of the webring's section (`_index.md`) page. It can also be overridden on a
        per member basis with `ToroidalRandomMemberLink` in the member page's front matter.

        This value only affects the inclusion of the link in member navigation, not the availability
        of the API for the webring.
    type: boolean
    default: true
  Class:
    title: Additional Class
    description: Specifies one or more classes to append to the generated HTML for webrings
    schematize:
      weight: 4
      details: |
        Specifies one or more classes to append to the generated HTML for webrings. To specify
        multiple classes, separate each class with a space. You can use this value with the defined
        themes to style a webring more specifically.

        This value can be overridden at the webring level by defining `ToroidalClass` in the front
        matter of the webring's section (`_index.md`) page. It can also be overridden on a per
        member basis with `ToroidalClass` in the member page's front matter.
    type: string
    default: ""
  Mode:
    title: Display Mode
    description: >-
      Specifies whether the Toroidal pages on the site should display in light or dark mode or use
      the site visitor's OS preference setting.
    schematize:
      weight: 3
      details: |
        Specifies whether the Toroidal pages on the site should display in light mode (`light`),
        dark mode (`dark`), or the mode that matches the site visitor's OS preferences (`auto`).

        This setting only has an effect if the module is used without the Platen module or when the
        `Toroidal.Enabled` feature for Platen is set to `false`.

        This setting only affects the member pages and their iframes, not the rest of the site.

        The default is `auto`.

  AdminDetails:
    title: Administration Details
    description: Specifies the partial to use for the "About Member Administration" details
    schematize:
      weight: 6
      details: |
        This setting defines the partial to use for the "About Member Administration" `details`
        element in a webring's administration page. It defaults to `default`. You can set it to
        `none` to intentionally exclude the details.

        The pre-defined options are:

        - `default` - Defined in `layouts/partials/toroidal/adminDetails/default.md`
        - `none` - Defined in `layouts/partials/toroidal/adminDetails/none.md`
        - `platen` - Defined in `layouts/partials/toroidal/adminDetails/platen.md`

        On Platen sites, when the `default` details would be used, `platen` is used instead to
        account for the differences between a Toroidal webring on a Platen site.
        
        ### Defining and Overriding Details

        You can override the pre-defined options by creating a file of the same name and path in
        your own site or module. You can also define entirely new options, as long as your partial
        is valid.

        The partial must return valid HTML or an empty string. If it returns an empty string, the
        details element isn't rendered.

        The partial gets the page context for the webring administration page as input.

        By default, this partial assumes that the specified details partial is a markdown file
        unless the name ends with a file extension. It also assumes that the partial is in
        `layouts/partials/toroidal/adminDetails` unless it has a path prefix, like
        `myWebring/details`.

        For example, consider the following mapping:

        - `default => toroidal/adminDetails/default.md` on non-Platen sites
        - `default => toroidal/adminDetails/platen.md` on Platen sites
        - `none    => toroidal/adminDetails/none.md`
        - `myWebring/details => myWebring/details.md`
        - `notMarkdown.thml` => toroidal/adminDetails/notMarkdown.html`

        If the partial file name has the `.md` or `.markdown` extension, the partial renders the
        Markdown to HTML.

        You can override this setting for any webring by setting [sref:`ToroidalAdminDetails`] in
        the administration page's front matter.

  HideHeader:
    title: Hide Header on Member Pages
    description: Specifies whether to hide the h2 element on member pages
    schematize:
      weight: 5
      details: |
        This setting specifies whether to hide the `h2` element on member pages. By default, every
        member page includes the webring's name as an `h2` at the top of the member's navigation.

        Set this value to `true` to hide the element on member pages for the site. You can override
        this setting on a per-webring basis by setting [sref:`ToroidalHideHeader`] in the webring's
        section page front matter or by setting [sref:`ToroidalHideHeader`] in the member page's
        front matter.
