    Platen is designed with version control in mind. These settings inform Platen about the version
    control host you're using

    title: Repository URL
    description: Defines the URL to the root of the repository on your version control host.

        Defines the URL to the root of the repository on your version control host.

    title: Commit Path
    description: Sets the repository-relative path for the "See this page's source" link.

        Sets the repository-relative path for the "See this page's source" link.
    type: string
    default: commit
  EditPath:
    title: Edit Path
    description: Sets the repository-relative path for the "Edit this page" link.

      weight: 3
      details: |
        Sets the repository-relative path for the "Edit this page" link.
    type: string
    default: edit/main
  ContentRoot:
    title: Repository-Relative Content Folder
    description: Specifies the path to the content folder relative to the repository root.
    schematize:
      weight: 4
      details: |
        Specifies the path to the content folder relative to the repository root. This is different
        from Hugo's `contentDir` setting, which specifies the path to the content folder relative to
        the Hugo project's root.

        This value is useful for defining the URLs for the "Edit this page" links, which need to
        point to where the file is located _in the repository_, not in the site layout. If your Hugo
        site isn't defined in a subfolder in your repository, you don't need to use this setting.

        Platen will attempt to use Hugo's `contentDir` parameter to resolve the file paths for you
        if it's set. It will trim any leading `../` from the value. If the automatic resolution for
        the value still gives you an incorrect URL, use this setting to define it explicitly.
    type: string
  MountedPaths:
    title: Mounted Content Paths
    description: Specifies maps for mounted content paths from repository-relative to site-relative.
    schematize:
      weight: 5
      details: |
        Specifies maps for mounted content paths to enable accurate and functional URLs for the
        "Edit this page" links when your site has mounted content. If you're not using Hugo modules
        to mount content from outside of your content directory, this setting does nothing.

        You can use this setting to correctly map to files in the same repository, another
        repository, or skip them entirely for a set of mounted content.
