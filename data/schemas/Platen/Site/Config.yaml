        Defines the configuration for shortcodes that integrate with Platen.

        While you can add shortcodes independently of this configuration, the setting provides a
        standardized and discoverable way for theme developers building on Platen to make their
        shortcodes usable for others without requiring modifying the base theme's files.

        Platen modules use this configuration to add their shortcodes and make them configurable.

        Shortcodes defined in this way must not depend on each other.
