  details: |
    In the position settings for [sref:`Platen.Display.Menu`], you can add entries to the site menu.
    These settings define how a specific entry is added to the menu.

    An entry must define either the [sref:`Feature`] or the [sref:`Group`] and [sref:`Entries`]
    settings.
    
    Entries with the [sref:`Feature`] setting are individual entries that leverage
    a partial defined by a Platen feature.

    Entries with the [sref:`Group`] setting acommodate a nested list of entries (defined in
    [sref:`Entries`]) in the menu, using this entry as the parent container.

        You can use the Toroidal feature to add a webring's navigation to the site menu without
        having to redefine each part of the navigation manually.

        For more information, see [sref:Toroidal Entry Settings].

        Specifies the name of the Platen feature this entry should use to write HTML in the menu.
        This value must map to the name of a feature that is usable for menu entries. A usable
        Feature:

        1. Has [sref:`Enabled`] set to `true`.
        2. Defines a value for [sref:`Partials.Menu`].

        If an entry references an unusable or non-existant feature, Hugo raises a warning and skips
        the entry.

        This setting is mandatory if the [sref:`Group`] setting isn't specified for the entry.

        Use this setting to control the where in the menu this entry is added for the current
        position and level. All weighted entries are added before unweighted modules. Weighted
        entries are added in order from lowest weight to highest. Unweighted entries are added in
        alphabetical order.
