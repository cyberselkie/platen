description: Defines an entry for a Toroidal webring in the site menu.

  details: |
    In the position settings for [sref:`Platen.Display.Menu`], you can add entries to the site menu.
    These settings define an entry using the Toroidal feature to add a webring's navigation to the
    site menu without having to redefine each part of the navigation manually.

    If you're hosting the webring, you can use the [sref:`PagePath`] setting to add navigation for a
    member using the site's styling. To add navigation for a webring hosted on another site, or if
    you want more control over how the webring's navigation is rendered, use the
    [sref:`PartialPath`] setting.

    In both cases, you must define the [sref:`Feature`] setting for the entry as `Toroidal` and may
    define the [sref:`Weight`] setting to control the ordering of the webring in the site menu.

    Navigation entries using [sref:`PagePath`] or [sref:`PartialPath`] with the default partial you
    can copy from your webring's administration page follow the same format:

    - They're added inside a grouping entry and have the navigation items nested inside it, matching
      the definition for the webring member's navigation page as normal, except they follow the
      styling for the Platen site menu.
    - You can use the [sref:`DisplayName`] setting to override the name of the containing item in
      the site menu for the webring's navigation. If you don't specify a display name, the webring's
      name is used instead.
    - You can use the [sref:`Collapse`] or [sref:`Flatten`] settings to override how the webring's
      navigation is displayed in the site menu.
    - You can use the [sref:`Class`] setting to add extra CSS classes to the webring navigation in
      the site menu.
    - If you're using the [sref:`PartialPath`] setting, you can add arbitrary settings to this entry
      that your partial is aware of. The entire entry is passed to the partial when it's rendered
      along with the context for the page the menu is being rendered on.

        Specifies the name of the Platen feature this entry should use to write HTML in the menu.
        To add a Toroidal webring nav, this value must be `Toroidal`.

  PagePath:

      details: |
        Specifies the path from the site's base URL for the member page to add navigation for.

        For example, if you're hosting a webring in the `content/neat-sites` folder and your site's
        member page in the webring is at `content/neat-sites/very-cool.md`, you would specify this
        value as `neat-sites/very-cool`.

        If it specifies an invalid value, such as a page that doesn't exist or isn't a Toroidal
        webring member page, Hugo raises an error.

        If neither this setting nor [sref:`PartialPath`] are defined, Hugo raises an error.

        Specifies the path to a partial to render for the webring navigation in the menu.

        You can get a partial for this purpose by following these steps:
        
        1. Navigate to the administration page for the webring on the host's site.
        1. Find the section for your member page.
        1. Use the "Copy Platen menu partial" button to copy the partial HTML to your clipboard.
        1. Create a new file in the `partials` folder for your site, like `partials/webring.html`.
        1. Paste the partial HTML into the new file.
        1. Save the file.

        For example, if you copied the Platen menu partial for your site from the webring's
        administration page to `partials/super-neat-webring/nav.html`, you would specify
        `super-neat-webring/nav` for this value.

        If you specify a value that Hugo can't resolve to a partial, Hugo raises an error.

        If neither this setting nor [sref:`PagePath`] are defined, Hugo raises an error.

        Specifies a display name for the containing element in the site menu. If this value isn't

        Specifies whether to collapse the webring entry in the site menu. Collapsed entries are
        displayed with a clickable arrow that expands and collapses the webring's entries,
        defaulting to collapsed.

        This setting is incompatible with [sref:`Flatten`]. A webring entry can be collapsed or
        flattened, but not both.

        Specifies whether to flatten the webring entry in the site menu. Flattened entries are
        displayed with the grouping entry bolded above a the webring's entries without additional
        spacing or indenting for those entries.

        This setting is incompatible with [sref:`Collapse`]. A webring entry can be collapsed or
        flattened, but not both.
