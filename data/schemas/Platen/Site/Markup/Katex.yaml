title: KaTeX Markup
description: Defines the settings for the KaTeX markup option
schematize:
  details: |
    Defines the map of settings for the Platen's KaTeX markup option. The existing value is a
    map that includes whether or not to enable the markup rendering, whether to always load the
    libraries on every page, and which version of KaTeX to use.

    When this markup is enabled, you can use [KaTeX][01] markup in your content with an
    [image link][02] (that has the `chem:`, `katex:`, or `math:` prefix), [codeblock][03] (whose
    language ID is `chem`, `katex`, and `math`), and even with KaTeX's own open/closing tags in
    normal Markdown content if [sref:`AlwaysLoad`] is set to `true`.

    With KaTeX, you can write mathematical and chemical formulae in plaintext and render them as
    beautiful formula on your site.

    You can override some of these settings at a [sref:content-level].

    You can add new keys or replace the values for existing ones. You don't need to keep the full
    list of all properties in your own configuration file. Only specify the values you want to add
    or replace.

    description: Choose whether the KaTeX style and libraries are always added to pages.
    schematize:
      details: |
        Choose whether the KaTeX style and library modules are always added to site pages. By
        default, the modules and style code are only added to pages where KaTeX markup is used
        with the codeblock render hook, the image render hook, or where the page's front matter
        has [sref:`Platen.Markup.Katex.AlwaysLoad`] set to `true`.

        When this setting is set to `true`, the modules are added to every page and will always
        be called to auto-render any valid KaTeX found on the page. This is useful for sites that
        make heavy use of inline KaTeX without the shortcode.

        The default value is `false`.

    description: Specify the version of KaTeX to load when needed.
    schematize:
      details: |
        Specify the version of KaTeX to load when needed. Platen retrieves the style and script
        modules for KaTeX from a CDN at build time. This value is used to determine which version to
        bundle with the site and use for auto-rendering.

        You can set this value to any valid released version of KaTeX, but if you override the
        default there may be incompatibilities with the available fonts. In that case, you'll need
        to also download the fonts for that version and add them to the `static/katex` folder,
        replacing the existing fonts.

        Due to the fragility of the KaTeX auto-rendering library and fonts, this setting can only be
        defined at the site level at this time.

  Aliases:

    description: Defines additional language IDs for the codeblock render hook.
    schematize:
      weight: 3
      details: |
        Define one or more aliases to use in addition to the default language IDs for codeblocks and
        alt text prefixes for image links
        that render KaTeX markup.

        The default language IDs for codeblocks are `katex` and `math` for math markup and `chem`
        for chemistry markup. The default prefixes for image links are `katex:` and `math:` for math
        markup and `chem:` for chemistry markup.

        You can specify a string, a map, or an array of strings or maps for this value. If the value
        is an array, each item in the array is added as an alias. Do not add a `:` suffix to any
        value.

        String values are added as valid language IDs/prefixes for the non-chemistry codeblocks in
        addition to `katex` and `math`.
        
        Map values must have either the `Math` or `Chemistry` key with a string value. If you define
        a value for `Math`, it becomes a valid language ID and prefix for math markup codeblocks and
        image links respectively. If you define a value for `Chemistry`, it becomes a valid language
        ID and prefix for chemistry markup codeblocks and image links respectively, which add the
        chemistry libraries even if you don't use a chemistry syntax. You can specify both in a
        single map but don't have to.

            If specified, this partial is processed in the HTML header with the current page's
            context. The default value is `platen/markup/katex/header`. You can overwrite
            this value, replacing it with another partial entirely, or you can add the same file to
            your own theme or site, effectively replacing it.

            The default partial pulls the KaTeX style and library modules from a CDN if any of the
            following conditions are met:
            
            1. The page content includes the `katex` shortcode
            1. The page content includes any codeblocks with `chem`, `katex`, or `math` as the
               language ID.
            1. The page front matter has [sref:`Platen.Markup.Katex.AlwaysLoad`] set to `true`
            1. The site is configured with [sref:`AlwaysLoad`] enabled.

            With the modules loaded, the page will automatically render any valid KaTeX on the
            page, displaying the formulae.

            Defines a map of partials to use as Markdown render hooks. Like all partials, these are
            only processed when [sref:`Enabled`] is set to `true`.

            Supported renderer partials include:

            - `Codeblock`, processed for fenced code blocks with a language ID
            - `Heading`, processed for headings
            - `Image`, processed for image links
            - `Link`, processed for non-image links

            In all cases, all renderer partials for enabled features and markup options are checked
            one after the other unless they return a render string. Only the first applicable
            partial that returns a render string is processed and rendered.

                Adds support for KaTeX and mhchem markup rendering for content. This render hook is only
                processed when the language ID for a codeblock is `chem`, `katex`, or `math`.

                It registers the current page as having KaTeX, which ensures the library and style
                modules are loaded for automatic rendering. If the codeblock uses the `\ce{...}` tag or
                has the `chem` language code, it registers the current page as having chemistry markup
                and ensures the mhchem KaTeX plugin is loaded as well.

                It renders the definition inside the codeblock inside a `span` element, denoting it as
                display-mode KaTeX by default. With the `class` attribute, it adds the specified classes
                to the element. With the `display` attribute, an author can explicitly control whether
                the span is rendered in display mode. Setting `display` to `false` renders the markup in
                inline mode.

                This value defaults to `platen/markup/katex/codeblock`. You can replace it with a
                different value, defining a new partial, or override the existing partial by creating
                the file `layouts/partials/platen/markup/katex/codeblock.html` in your own site or
                module.

                Adds support for KaTeX and mhchem markup rendering for content. This render hook is
                only processed when the alt text for an image link has the `chem:`, `katex:`, or
                `math:` prefix.

                It registers the current page as having KaTeX, which ensures the library and style
                modules are loaded for automatic rendering. If the codeblock uses the `\ce{...}` tag
                or has the `chem:` prefix, it registers the current page as having chemistry markup
                and ensures the mhchem KaTeX plugin is loaded as well.

                It renders the alt text (with the prefix trimmed away) as a `span` element, denoting it as
                inline-mode KaTeX.

                This value defaults to `platen/markup/katex/image`. You can replace it with a
                different value, defining a new partial, or override the existing partial by
                creating the file `layouts/partials/platen/markup/katex/image.html` in your own
                site or module.
