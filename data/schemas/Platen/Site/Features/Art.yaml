    Defines the map of settings for the Platen's [Art][01] feature. The existing value is a
    map that includes whether or not to enable the shortcode and the style definition for it.

    You can add new keys or replace the values for existing ones. You don't need to keep the
    full list of all properties in your own configuration file. Only specify the values you want
    to add or replace.

        Choose whether the site renders image links with the `art:` prefix in their alt text as art
        or normal images. If this setting is set to `true`, any images added with the prefix are
        rendered in figures with an optional caption and content warning. If this setting is
        `false`, the images are rendered as normal.

        Define a map of partials for Platen to inject as needed. These partials are only
        injected when [sref:`Enabled`] is set to `true`.

          details: |
            Defines a map of partials to use as Markdown render hooks. Like all partials, these are
            only processed when `Enabled` is set to `true`.

            Supported renderer partials include:

            - `Codeblock`, processed for fenced code blocks with a language ID
            - `Heading`, processed for headings
            - `Image`, processed for image links
            - `Link`, processed for non-image links

            In all cases, all renderer partials for enabled features are checked one after the other
            unless they return a render string. Only the first applicable partial that returns a
            render string is processed and rendered.

                Adds support for rendering images as artwork in Platen. This render hook is only
                called if the alt text for the image (i.e. `![altText](source "title")`) has the
                `art:` prefix. If the image does have the prefix, it's processed for adding the
                image in a `<figure>` element with an optional caption and content warning.

                For more information about how to use this render partial, see
                [the reference documentation][01] for this render hook.

                For more information about defining codeblock render hook partials, see
                [Defining a Codeblock Render Hook Partial][01] in the [Theme Guide][02].
