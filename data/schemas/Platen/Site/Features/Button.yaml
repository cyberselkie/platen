    Defines the map of settings for the Platen's [Button][01] feature. The existing value is a
    map that includes whether or not to enable the image render hook and its style definition.

    You can add new keys or replace the values for existing ones. You don't need to keep the
    full list of all properties in your own configuration file. Only specify the values you want
    to add or replace.

        Choose whether the site renders image links with the `button:` or `btn:` prefix in their alt
        text as buttons or normal image links. If this setting is set to `true`, any image links
        added with the prefix are rendered as anchor ([sref:`<a>`]) elements styled like a button.
        If this setting is `false`, the image links are rendered as normal.

        Define one or more prefixes to use in addition to the default prefixes (`button` and `btn`)
        for button image links.

        You can specify a string or an array of strings. If the value is an array, each item in the
        array is added as an alias. Do not add a `:` suffix.

            Defines a map of partials to use as Markdown render hooks. Like all partials, these are
            only processed when `Enabled` is set to `true`.

            Supported renderer partials include:

            - `Codeblock`, processed for fenced code blocks with a language ID
            - `Heading`, processed for headings
            - `Image`, processed for image links
            - `Link`, processed for non-image links

            In all cases, all renderer partials for enabled features are checked one after the other
            unless they return a render string. Only the first applicable partial that returns a
            render string is processed and rendered.

              details: |
                Adds support for rendering image links as buttons in Platen. This render hook is
                only called if the alt text for the image (i.e. `![altText](source "title")`) has
                the `button:` or `btn` prefix. If the image link does have the prefix, it's
                processed for adding an anchor ([sref:`<a>`]) element styled as a button. Activating
                the button takes the site visitor to the page defined by the `source` input.

                For more information about how to use this render partial, see
                [the reference documentation][01] for this render hook.

                For more information about defining codeblock render hook partials, see
                [Defining a Codeblock Render Hook Partial][02] in the [Theme Guide][03].
