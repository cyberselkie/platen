            If specified, this partial is processed in the HTML header with the current page's
            context. The default value is `platen/features/pwa/header`. You can overwrite
            this value, replacing it with another partial entirely, or you can add the same file to
            your own theme or site, effectively replacing it.

            The default partial creates the service worker (`sw.js`) and manifest (`manifest.json`)
            files required to turn the static website into a progressive web application. The
            service worker is created from the `scripts/features/pwa/sw-register.js` resource and
            processed as a template. The manifest is created from the
            `scripts/features/pwa/manifest.json` resource and also processed as a template. Both are
            then inserted into the HTML header.
        type: string
