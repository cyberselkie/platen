    Defines the map of settings for the Platen's [Columns][01] feature. The existing value is a
    map that includes whether or not to enable the feature and the style definition for it.

    You can add new keys or replace the values for existing ones. You don't need to keep the
    full list of all properties in your own configuration file. Only specify the values you want
    to add or replace.

        Choose whether the site renders codeblocks with the `columns` language ID as a group of
        columns with a flexible width. If this setting is set to `true`, content inside the
        codeblock is added inside a `<div>` that renders child divs as columns. If this setting is
        `false`, the content is rendered as an unhighlighted codeblock.

      details: |
        Define one or more language IDs to use in addition to the default language IDs for codeblocks
        that render their content in a group of divs as columns. The default for the top-level
        codeblock for the column group is `columns`. The default for the nested codeblock defining a
        single column is `column`.

        You can specify a string, a map, or an array of strings or maps for this value. If the value
        is an array, each item in the array is added as an alias.

        String values are added as valid language IDs for the top-level codeblock in addition to
        `columns`.

        Map values must have either the `Group` or `Entry` key with a string value. If you
        define a value for `Group`, it becomes a valid language ID for the top-level codeblock. If
        you define a value for `Entry`, it becomes a valid language ID for the nested codeblock. You
        can specify both in a single map but don't have to.

            Defines a map of partials to use as Markdown render hooks. Like all partials, these are
            only processed when `Enabled` is set to `true`.

            Supported renderer partials include:

            - `Codeblock`, processed for fenced code blocks with a language ID
            - `Heading`, processed for headings
            - `Image`, processed for image links
            - `Link`, processed for non-image links

            In all cases, all renderer partials for enabled features are checked one after the other
            unless they return a render string. Only the first applicable partial that returns a
            render string is processed and rendered.

                Adds support for rendering codeblocks as columns in Platen. This render hook is only
                called if the language ID for the codeblock (i.e. `` ```languageID ``) is
                `columns`. If a codeblock does include the language ID, the renderer looks for any
                nested codeblocks with the `column` language ID to render as columns in a shared
                group.

                For more information about how to use this render partial, see
                [the reference documentation][01] for this render hook.

                For more information about defining codeblock render hook partials, see
                [Defining a Codeblock Render Hook Partial][02] in the [Theme Guide][02].
