title: Schematize Reference Map
description: Defines a map of reference targets for schematized documentation.
schematize:
  details: |
    Schematize includes the `sref` shortcode and link renderer, which you can use to more easily
    reference documentation. An entry in the `sref_map` defines information for the shortcode
    and renderer to use when referencing external documentation.

    The [sref:`srefBase`] setting defines the base URL for the reference. The
    [sref:`srefSuffix`] setting defines an optional automatic postix to add to the link text
    when using the shortcode and is ignored by the link renderer.

    You can arbitrarily nest maps within each other to keep references from the same source but
    with different base URLs together in a usable way.

    For example, you could define a map for Mozilla's web documentation like this:

    ```yaml
    Schematize:
      ReferenceMap:
        mdn:
          srefSuffix: in the MDN documentation
          srefBase: https://developer.mozilla.org/docs
          css:
            srefBase: https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS
    ```

    And then access it with in the link reference:

    ```markdown
    Checkout [sref:`text-decoration`] in the MDN documentation.

    [sref:`text-decoration`]: mdn.css:text-decoration
    ```

    Which turns into:

    > Checkout [sref:`text-decoration`] in the MDN documentation.

    [sref:`text-decoration`]: mdn.css:text-decoration

      details: |
        Specifies the base URL to prefix sref values with for this target. Leaf nodes in the map
        (ones that don't define a nested map) **must** define this value or they can't be used
        to reference external documentation.
