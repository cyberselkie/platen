{{/*
    Docs.Partial: getSafeAttributes

    This partial takes a slice of HTML element attributes as strings and returns
    the strings delimited by a single space, marked as safe for insertion as
    HTML attributes.

    This makes it more convenient to build attribute lists for elements to let
    you render them when needed.
