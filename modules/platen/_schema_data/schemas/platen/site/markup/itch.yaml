description: Defines the options for Platen's itch embed markup
schematize:
  details: |
    Defines the map of options for Platen's itch embed markup. The existing value is a map that
    includes whether or not to enable the image render hook and its style definition.

    When this markup is enabled, you can embed [itch.io widgets][01] into your site with
    [an image link][02].

    You can add new keys or replace the values for existing ones. You don't need to keep the full
    list of all properties in your own configuration file. Only specify the values you want to add
    or replace.

        Choose whether the site renders image links with the `itch:` prefix in their alt text as
        embedded itch widgets. If this setting is set to `true`, any image links added with the prefix
        are rendered as [sref:`<iframe>`] elements using the URL of the link as the widget's ID.
        
        If this setting is `false`, the image links are treated as normal.

        Define one or more prefixes to use in addition to the default prefix (`itch`) for embedded
        itch widgets.

        You can specify a string or an array of strings. If the value is an array, each item in the
        array is added as an alias. Do not add a `:` suffix.

    description: Set itch embeds to render with the dark theme by default.
    schematize:
      weight: 3
      details: |
        Specifies whether the embed widgets should use itch's default dark theme instead of the default light theme.
        This value is overridden if the `dark` [attribute][01] or [preset property][02] is set for the markup.

    schematize:
      weight: 4
      details: |
        Specifies whether the project's cover image should be a clickable link to the project page on itch. When this
        value is `false`, the cover image isn't a link. This value is overridden if the `linkback` [attribute][01] or
        [preset property][02] is set for the markup.

      details: |
        Specifies that the embed widget should display as a square instead of the long rectangle. In this display, only
        the cover is visible with the button for buying the project. This value is overridden if the `square`
        [attribute][01] or [preset property][02] is set for the markup.

            Defines a map of partials to use as Markdown render hooks. Like all partials, these are
            only processed when [sref:`enabled`] is set to `true`.

            Supported renderer partials include:

            - `codeblock`, processed for fenced code blocks with a language ID
            - `heading`, processed for headings
            - `image`, processed for image links
            - `link`, processed for non-image links

            In all cases, all renderer partials for enabled features and markup options are checked
            one after the other unless they return a render string. Only the first applicable
            partial that returns a render string is processed and rendered.

              details: |
                Adds support for rendering image links as embedded itch widgets in Platen. This
                render hook is only called if the alt text for the image (i.e.
                `![alt_text](source "title")`) has the `itch:` prefix. If an image link does have
                the prefix, it's processed for adding an embedded itch widget as an
                [sref:`<iframe>`] element, using the `source` as the widget's ID.

                For more information about how to use image links to render itch widgets, see
                [the reference documentation][01].

                This value defaults to `platen/markup/itch/image`. You can replace it with a
                different value and defining a new partial, or override the existing partial by
                creating the file `layouts/partials/platen/markup/itch/image.html` in your own site
                or module.

                For more information about defining codeblock render hook partials, see
                [Defining a Codeblock Render Hook Partial][02] in the [Theme Guide][03].
