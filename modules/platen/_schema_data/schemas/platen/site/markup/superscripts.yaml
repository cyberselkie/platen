    Defines the map of options for Platen's [superscripts markup][01]. The existing value is a map that
    includes whether or not to enable the image render hook and its style definition.

    You can add new keys or replace the values for existing ones. You don't need to keep the
    full list of all properties in your own configuration file. Only specify the values you want
    to add or replace.

        Choose whether the site renders image links with the `sup:` prefix in their alt text as superscripts or normal
        image links. If this setting is set to `true`, any image links added with the prefix are rendered as superscript
        ([sref:`<sup>`]) elements. If this setting is `false`, the image links are rendered as normal.

        Define one or more prefixes to use in addition to the default prefix (`sup`) for superscript image links.

        You can specify a string or an array of strings. If the value is an array, each item in the array is added as
        an alias. Do not add a `:` suffix.

            Defines a map of partials to use as Markdown render hooks. Like all partials, these are
            only processed when [sref:`enabled`] is set to `true`.

            Supported renderer partials include:

            - `codeblock`, processed for fenced code blocks with a language ID
            - `heading`, processed for headings
            - `image`, processed for image links
            - `link`, processed for non-image links

            In all cases, all renderer partials for enabled features and markup options are checked
            one after the other unless they return a render string. Only the first applicable
            partial that returns a render string is processed and rendered.

              details: |
                Adds support for rendering image links as superscripts in Platen. This render hook is only called if the
                alt text for the image (i.e. `![altText](source "title")`) has the `sup:` prefix. If the image link
                does have the prefix, it's processed for adding an superscript ([sref:`<sup>`]) element.

                For more information about how to use this render partial, see [the reference documentation][01] for
                this render hook.

                For more information about defining image render hook partials, see
                [Defining an Image Render Hook Partial][02] in the [Theme Guide][03].
