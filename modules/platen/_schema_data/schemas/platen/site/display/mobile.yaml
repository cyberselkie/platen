        Use these settings to control the display for the button that shows the site menu on mobile. The button appears
        in the top left corner of each page beside the page's title. When a visitor clicks it, the site menu pops out
        from the left side of the screen.

        At this time, the `use_legacy` setting for this control defaults to `true`, which makes Platen render your site
        with the old control. The old control is not configurable. In the future, the default value for this control
        will be updated to `false`. Later, the option to use the legacy control will be removed entirely.

        We strongly recommend that you set `use_legacy` to `false` and update your site's theme as needed.

            This setting specifies the name of the icon to display. You can specify the icon with Platen's shorthand
            syntax for icons.

            The shorthand syntax for icons in Platen is `<name>[&<variant>][@<library>]`, where:

            - `<name>` is mandatory and represents the name of the icon.
            - `&<variant>` is optional and represents the variant of the icon. Not all icons and libraries support
              variants. When you specify a variant in this syntax, you must specify it after the icon's name. You must
              separate the variant from the icon name with an ampersand (`&`). When you don't specify a variant, Platen
              uses the library's default variant.
            - `&<library>` is optional and represents the library the icon belongs to. When you specify a library in
              this syntax, you must specify it after the icon's name and variant. You must separate the library from
              the icon name or variant with an at sign (`@`). When you don't specify a library, Platen uses the
              configured default library.

            You can always use [sref:any valid icon] in Shoelace's default icon library.

            If you specify the icon's variant or library with the shorthand syntax, don't specify the [sref:`variant`]
            or [sref:`library`] settings for this icon.

            The default icon for this setting is: ![icon:list][default]

            [sref:any valid icon]: sl.component:icon?default-icons

            This setting defines the accessible label for the icon button. A label helps users understand what a button
            without text does.

            Specify a short plaintext message explaining what the button does. If you specify this value with the
            prefix `i18n!`, like `i18n!foo_bar`, Platen looks up the value as a key in your site's internationalization

                active.

                The default value in Shoelace is `8` pixels.

                Use this setting to determine how many pixels from the defined placement the tooltip renders along the
                icon. This shifts the tooltip along the cross-axis from the `distance` setting.

                The default value in Shoelace is `0` pixels.

            Use this setting to choose whether to use the legacy implementation for the mobile menu control. The current
            default value is `true`, which renders the old SVG icon and ignores all other settings for the control.
            
            In the future, the default value will change to `false`. Later, this setting will be removed and only the
            new implementation will be available. We strongly recommend you update this setting to `false` and adjust
            your site's theme as needed.
