  details: |
    In the position settings for [sref:`platen.display.menu`], you can group entries at the
    top-level or nested in the entries list. These settings determine how those grouped entries are
    displayed.

    If this setting isn't defined at the top-level for a position, all entries for that position are
    added in an unordered list without a containing item to indicate that they're semantically
    related.

    You can use this setting for individual entries, creating a nested group of related entries.

        Specifies the URL clicking the group entry in the site menu should take a visitor to. If
        this value isn't specified, the group entry still contains its entries but it can't be
        navigated to.

      details: |
        Specifies whether to collapse the group entry in the site menu. Collapsed entries are
        displayed with a clickable arrow that expands and collapses the group's entries, defaulting
        to collapsed.

        This setting is incompatible with [sref:`flatten`]. A group entry can be collapsed or
        flattened, but not both.

        Specifies whether to flatten the group entry in the site menu. Flattened entries are
        displayed with the grouping entry bolded above a the group's entries without additional
        spacing or indenting for those entries.

        This setting is incompatible with [sref:`collapse`]. A group entry can be collapsed or
        flattened, but not both.

    title: Group Entry Class

      Specifies a class to add to the group entry in the site menu.

      details: |
        Specifies a class to add to the group entry in the site menu. To specify more than one
        class, separate each class with a space.

        If this value isn't specified, the group is added without any class injection. If this value
        is specified, the class declaration is injected in the top-level unordered list (`<ul>`) if
        the group is declared at the top-level for a position or in the unordered list containing
        the group's entries if the group is nested in the entries list.

        Top-level lists without the `platen` class are added to the site menu with a small margin
        above them. To ensure a top-level group is added to the site menu without this additional
        spacing, set this value to `platen`.
