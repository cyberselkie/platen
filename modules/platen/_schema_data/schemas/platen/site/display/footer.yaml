        These settings control the "edit this page" button Platen adds to the footer of every page. The button links
        to the source control web page for editing the current page. You can disable this link by setting `enabled` to

            Use this setting to choose whether the button link should display in the page's footer. When you set this
            value to `true`, the button link is added to the footer. When you set this value to `false`, the button
            link is ignored during the page render.

                Specify the name of the icon to use for the button link. You can use the shorthand syntax for this
                value instead of specifying values for the `library` and `variant` options.

                The shorthand syntax for icons in Platen is `<name>[&<variant>][@<library>]`, where:

                - `<name>` is mandatory and represents the name of the icon.
                - `&<variant>` is optional and represents the variant of the icon. Not all icons and libraries support
                  variants. When you specify a variant in this syntax, you must specify it after the icon's name. You
                  must separate the variant from the icon name with an ampersand (`&`). When you don't specify a
                  variant, Platen uses the library's default variant.
                - `&<library>` is optional and represents the library the icon belongs to. When you specify a library
                  in this syntax, you must specify it after the icon's name and variant. You must separate the library
                  from the icon name or variant with an at sign (`@`). When you don't specify a library, Platen uses
                  the configured default library.

                This setting specifies the library to load the icon from. You can use any of the registered icon
                libraries. If you don't specify a value for this setting, Platen uses the
                `features.shoelace.icons.default_library` setting's value as the library.

                Don't specify this setting if you're including the library in the `name` setting with the shorthand
                syntax.

            Use this setting to choose whether to use the legacy implementation for the "edit this page" footer link.
            The current default value is `true`, which renders the old SVG icon and fixed link text, and ignores all

            In the future, the default value will change to `false`. Later, this setting will be removed and only the
