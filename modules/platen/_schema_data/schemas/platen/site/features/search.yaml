            If specified, this partial is processed in the HTML header with the current page's
            context. The default value is `platen/features/search/header`. You can overwrite
            this value, replacing it with another partial entirely, or you can add the same file to
            your own theme or site, effectively replacing it.

            The default partial creates a per-language javascript file for searching the site and
            executes `scripts/features/search/index.js` as a templated resource. It adds a link to
            the search scripts into the HTML header, allowing a user to search the site from the
            menu.

        default: platen/features/search/header
