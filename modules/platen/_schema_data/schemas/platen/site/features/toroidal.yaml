description: Settings that control Platen's integration with the Toroidal webring feature.

  details: |
    Defines settings that control Platen's integration with the Toroidal webring feature. These
    settings are only effective if the [Toroidal module][01] is imported for your site. They are
    provided by that module, not Platen itself.

      details: |
        Choose whether Platen integrates with the Toroidal module for styling and member page
        titles. If this value is set to `true`, the Toroidal pages are integrated into Platen
        for styling. If this value is set to `false`, the Toroidal pages use their own styling
        only. The default is `true`.

        Define a map of partials for Platen to inject as needed. These partials are only
        injected when [sref:`enabled`] is set to `true`.

            This partial is processed in `platen.scss`, which defines the site's style. This partial
            is processed after the theme's builtin styles but before the shortcode styles, allowing
            a shortcode to depend on it.

            It imports every SCSS style module defined in [sref:`toroidal.themes`] that isn't disabled. The
            style modules must be located in the `assets/toroidal/themes` folder.

            This value defaults to `platen/features/toroidal/style.scss`. You can set this to
            another partial to change how the theme styles are imported or add the same file in the
            `layouts` folder (`partials/platen/features/toroidal/style.scss`) to effectively replace
            the functionality.

            This partial is called when determining the HTML header title for a page, which sets the
            name of the browser tab and is used in Open Graph.

            This partial is called for all pages but only defines the title for member pages (pages
            that define `toroidal_home_page` in their front matter). For all other pages, this
            partial returns an empty string.

            For member pages, this partial returns the title as `<Member Name> | <Webring Name>`.
            
            This value defaults to `platen/features/toroidal/title`. You can set this to another
            partial to change how the title is generated or add the same file in the `layouts`
            folder (`partials/platen/features/toroidal/title.html`) to effectively replace the
            functionality.
