  details: |
    Platen is in the process of more closely integrating the excellent set of web components from [Shoelace][01] into
    the site theme. This gives you a set of very configurable and customizable components to use on your site and in
    your markup.

        Choose whether the site can use Shoelace web components. The default is `true`.

        If you disable the Shoelace web components, you may need to radically update the markup and layout for Platen.

      details: |
        Use this setting to choose whether the link to the Shoelace library should be added to every page. Platen uses
        Shoelace's autoloading feature, which means that it only retrieves code from Shoelace on an as-needed basis.

        We strongly recommend leaving this option set to `true` to minimize complexity. This allows you to use any
        Shoelace components in your own markdown or special markup without needing to add handlers to cherry pick the
        components yourself.
    type: boolean

        Use this setting to choose the version of Shoelace to load for your site. Platen regularly updates this version
        after testing. You can override it to specify an earlier version or set this value to `latest` to always
        retrieve the latest released version.

            You can use this setting to use a different icon library by default. As long as this setting maps to the
            name or alias of a registered library, Platen will use that library by default for its markup and any icons
            you specify for theme components.

            Use this setting to create a list of icon libraries that Platen should always load, even when the icons
            aren't used in Platen's markup or a theme component. This is mostly useful if you're using inline Shoelace
            components or adding your own markup outside of Platen's configuration.

            By default, Platen checks any specified icon in your markup or theme components and maintains a list of
            icon libraries to register for each page on your behalf. You can freely use the configured libraries without
            having to ensure they register.

            These settings control the registration and behavior for icon libraries to use in Shoelace web components
            for Platen. Platen provides default configuration and registration for a dozen different icon libraries.

            You can also define your own icon libraries to register with Platen. For now, see the implementations for
            the existing libraries. You can reach out to the maintainers if you have questions or want another library
            added to the built-in supported libraries.

            If specified, this partial is processed in the HTML header with the current page's context. The default
            value is `platen/features/shoelace/header`. You can overwrite this value, replacing it with another partial
            entirely, or you can add the same file to your own theme or site, effectively replacing it.

            The default partial loads Shoelace from the CDN for use. It also adds a helper script, called `modeSwap.js`
            from `assets/scripts/shoelace/modeSwap.js`, which helps support automatic theming between light and dark
            modes. Finally, it sets up registration for Shoelace's icon libraries.
