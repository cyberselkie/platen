  details: |
    Defines the map of base SCSS style modules for the theme. The existing value is a map of
    styles that are loaded first for the theme and set defaults for the presentation.

    You can add new keys or replace the values for existing ones. You don't need to keep the
    full list of all styles in your own configuration file. Only specify the values you want
    to add or replace.

    title: HTML Style Module
    description: Defines the base style for the html element.
    schematize:
      weight: 1
      skip_schema_render: true
      details: |
        Defines the base style for the `html` element. By default, the only setting for this
        property is [sref:`enabled`], which defaults to `true`. If you set [sref:`enabled`] to
        `false`, this style isn't applied to the site.

        With [sref:`enabled`] set to `true`, Platen applies the following style to the site:

        ```scss
        html {
          font-size: $font-size-base;
          scroll-behavior: smooth;
          touch-action: manipulation;
        }
        ```

        This applies to the `html` element and its children, setting the default font size to the
        value defined in [sref:`theme.variables.basic_scss.font-size-base`]. This defines the value
        of [sref:`rem`] units for the theme and effects the size of most elements.

        It also sets the scroll behavior to [sref:`smooth`], which makes scrolling the site less
        jarring for visitors.

        Finally, it sets the touch action to [sref:`manipulation`], which makes the site work
        predictably for mobile and tablet users.

        You can overwrite this definition for your own site or theme by creating the file
        `styles/base/_html.scss` in your [assets folder], which defaults to `assets` in
        your project root.

        ```details { .danger summary="Careful!" }
        Note that if you create this file, it _entirely overwrites_ the default from the theme.
        ```

    description: Defines the base style for the body element.
    schematize:
      weight: 2
      skip_schema_render: true
      details: |
        Defines the base style for the `body` element. By default, the only setting for this
        property is [sref:`enabled`], which defaults to `true`. If you set [sref:`enabled`] to
        `false`, this style isn't applied to the site.

        With [sref:`enabled`] set to `true`, Platen applies the following style to the site:

        ```scss
        body {
          min-width: $body-min-width;
          color: var(--body-font-color);
          background: var(--body-background);

          letter-spacing: 0.33px;
          font-weight: $body-font-weight;
          text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;
          -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
          -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;

          box-sizing: border-box;
          * {
            box-sizing: inherit;
          }
        }
        ```

        This applies to the `body` element and its children, setting the minimum width of the
        container to the value defined in [sref:`theme.variables.basic_scss.body-min-width`] and
        setting the color of the font and background based on the values defined in the
        [sref:`light`] or [sref:`dark`] theme, depending on which is active.

        It sets the [sref:letter spacing] to `0.33px`, which keeps the font readable.

        It sets the default weight of the font to the value defined in
        [sref:`theme.variables.basic_scss.body-font-weight`].

        The settings for [sref:text rendering] and font-smoothing ensure that the text displays best
        for reading on the site visitor's device.

        The [sref:box sizing] ensures that the border and padding values of elements are taken into
        account for placement and visibility.

        You can overwrite this definition for your own site or theme by creating the file
        `styles/base/_body.scss` in your [assets folder], which defaults to `assets` in
        your project root.

        ```details { .danger summary="Careful!" }
        Note that if you create this file, it _entirely overwrites_ the default from the theme.
        ```

        Defines the base style for the `h1` through `h6` elements. By default, the only setting for
        this property is [sref:`enabled`], which defaults to `true`. If you set [sref:`enabled`] to
        `false`, this style isn't applied to the site.

        With [sref:`enabled`] set to `true`, Platen applies the following style to the site:

        ```scss
        h1,
        h2,
        h3,
        h4,
        h5 {
          font-weight: $body-font-weight;
        }
        ```

        This applies to the `h*` elements, setting their font-weight to the value defined in
        [sref:`theme.variables.basic_scss.body-font-weight`].

        You can overwrite this definition for your own site or theme by creating the file
        `styles/base/_headings.scss` in your [assets folder], which defaults to `assets` in
        your project root.

      details: |
        Defines the base style for the `a` elements (links). By default, the only setting for this
        property is [sref:`enabled`], which defaults to `true`. If you set [sref:`enabled`] to
        `false`, this style isn't applied to the site.

        With [sref:`enabled`] set to `true`, Platen applies the following style to the site:

        ```scss
        a {
          text-decoration: none;
          color: var(--color-link);
        }
        ```

        This applies to the `a` elements, setting their color to the value defined in
        [sref:`theme.variables.light_css.color-link`] or
        [sref:`theme.variables.dark_css.color-link`], depending on whether the site is displaying in
        light or dark [sref:`theme.config.mode`]. It also removes the default underline beneath
        links by setting [sref:`text-decoration`] to `none`.

        You can overwrite this definition for your own site or theme by creating the file
        `styles/base/_headings.scss` in your [assets folder], which defaults to `assets` in
        your project root.

        Defines the base style for `img` elements. By default, the only setting for this property is
        [sref:`enabled`], which defaults to `true`. If you set [sref:`enabled`] to `false`, this
        style isn't applied to the site.

        With [sref:`enabled`] set to `true`, Platen applies the following style to the site:

        ```scss
        img {
          vertical-align: baseline;
        }
        ```

        This applies to the `img` elements, setting their vertical alignment to [sref:`baseline`],
        which aligns the image relative to its parent's baseline.

        You can overwrite this definition for your own site or theme by creating the file
        `styles/base/_headings.scss` in your [assets folder], which defaults to `assets` in
        your project root.

      details: |
        Defines the base style for elements the vistor has in focus. By default, the only setting
        for this property is [sref:`enabled`], which defaults to `true`. If you set [sref:`enabled`] to `false`,
        this style isn't applied to the site.

        With [sref:`enabled`] set to `true`, Platen applies the following style to the site:

        ```scss
        :focus {
          @include outline;
        }
        ```

        This applies to the any elements when the {{% sref ":focus" "mdn.css" "noPostFix" %}}`:focus` selector{{% /sref %}}
        applies. It ensures the utility [mixin] defined in [sref:`theme.styles.utils.outline`] is
        applied to those elements.

        You can overwrite this definition for your own site or theme by creating the file
        `styles/base/_headings.scss` in your [assets folder], which defaults to `assets` in

    schematize:
      weight: 7
      skip_schema_render: true
      details: |
        Defines the base style for the navigation menus, both the site menu and the table of
        contents for a page. By default, the only setting for this property is [sref:`enabled`],
        which defaults to `true`. If you set [sref:`enabled`] to `false`, this style isn't applied
        to the site.

        With [sref:`enabled`] set to `true`, Platen applies the following style to the site:

        ```scss
        aside nav ul {
          padding: 0;
          margin: 0;
          list-style: none;

          li {
            margin: 1em 0;
            position: relative;
          }

          a {
            display: block;
          }

          a:hover {
            opacity: 0.5;
          }

          ul {
            padding-inline-start: $padding-large;
          }
        }
        ```

        This applies to the `ul` elements and their children when the `ul` is in a `nav` container
        in an `aside`, which is the case for the site menu and for the table of contents for a page.

        It sets the padding and margin for the list itself to `0` and sets the list style to `none`,
        ensuring there's no bullet points shown before the items.

        For the list items it sets the vertical margin to `1rem`, giving them a little space between
        entries, and sets their position as relative to their container.

        For the links themselves, it sets them to display as block items instead of inline, making
        it possible to click anywhere in their area to navigate to the page, making it easier to use
        with touch devices and more convenient generally. When a site visitor hovers on a link, the
        link's opacity is reduced by half to give a visual cue that clicking will select that item.

        For nested lists, which includes submenus, it sets the [sref:`padding-inline-start`] to the
        value of the [sref:`theme.variables.basic_scss.padding-large`] variable.

        You can overwrite this definition for your own site or theme by creating the file
        `styles/base/_headings.scss` in your [assets folder], which defaults to `assets` in
        your project root.

        ```details { .danger summary="Careful!" }
        Note that if you create this file, it _entirely overwrites_ the default from the theme.

      details: |
        Defines the base style for the pagination lists. By default, the only setting for this
        property is [sref:`enabled`], which defaults to `true`. If you set [sref:`enabled`] to
        `false`, this style isn't applied to the site.

        With [sref:`enabled`] set to `true`, Platen applies the following style to the site:

        ```scss
        ul.pagination {
          display: flex;
          justify-content: center;
          list-style-type: none;

          .page-item a {
            padding: $padding-large;
          }
        }
        ```

        This applies to the `ul` elements with the `pagination` class, which is used to render the
        list of blog posts and taxonomy terms. It uses the [sref:flexible box layout] for these
        lists, ensuring that the links to the next set of pages are evenly spaced and don't include
        a leading bullet point. It uses the [sref:`theme.variables.basic_scss.padding-large`]
        variable to set padding around the links.

        You can overwrite this definition for your own site or theme by creating the file
        `styles/base/_headings.scss` in your [assets folder], which defaults to `assets` in
        your project root.

        ```details { .danger summary="Careful!" }

        Defines the base style for elements with the container class. By default, the only setting
        for this property is [sref:`enabled`], which defaults to `true`. If you set
        [sref:`enabled`] to `false`, this style isn't applied to the site.

        With [sref:`enabled`] set to `true`, Platen applies the following style to the site:

          max-width: $container-max-width;
          margin: 0 auto;
        }
        ```

        This applies to any element with the `container` class, which includes only the `main`
        element by default. It sets the maximum width to the value defined in
        [sref:`theme.variables.basic_scss.container-max-width`], sets the vertical margin to `0`, and
        sets the horizontal margin to `auto`, centering it in the available space.

        You can overwrite this definition for your own site or theme by creating the file
        `styles/base/_headings.scss` in your [assets folder], which defaults to `assets` in your
