title: Renderer Partials
description: Registers one or more partials that act as render hooks.
type: object
schematize:
  details: |
    Defines a map of partials to use as Markdown render hooks. Like all partials, these are only
    processed when `enabled` is set to `true`.

    Supported renderer partials include:

    - [sref:`codeblock`], processed for fenced code blocks with a language ID
    - [sref:`heading`], processed for headings
    - [sref:`image`], processed for image links
    - [sref:`link`], processed for non-image links

    In all cases, all renderer partials for enabled features are checked one after the other unless
    they return a render string. Once an applicable partial returns a render string, no further
    render hook partials are processed for that specific content.

      details: |
        If specified, this partial is processed when a fenced codeblock with a language ID is
        rendered from Markdown. This support is in addition to Hugo's normal method for adding
        [codeblock render hooks][01] per language.
        
        In Platen, codeblock render hook partials registered by features are processed one at a time
        for each enabled feature with a defined codeblock render hook partial until one of them
        returns a non-empty string representing the rendered content.

        If no codeblock render hook partial returns a rendered string, the default codeblock render
        hook is called instead. The first codeblock render hook partial to return a non-empty string
        ends the render hook processing. Any remaining render hook partials are never processed for
        that codeblock.

        A feature can only define one codeblock render hook partial.

        For more information about defining codeblock render hook partials, see
        [Defining a Codeblock Render Hook Partial][02] in the [Theme Guide][03].

      details: |
        If specified, this partial is processed when a heading is rendered from Markdown. This
        support allows you to extend the default heading render hook without replacing it. You can
        still [define additional heading render hooks][01] on a per-output-format basis, like a
        custom heading output for content in an RSS feed.
        
        In Platen, heading render hook partials registered by features are processed one at a time
        for each enabled feature with a defined heading render hook partial until one of them
        returns a non-empty string representing the rendered content.

        If no heading render hook partial returns a rendered string, the default heading render hook
        is called instead. The first heading render hook partial to return a non-empty string ends
        the render hook processing. Any remaining render hook partials are never processed for that
        heading.

        A feature can only define one heading render hook partial.

        If specified, this partial is processed when a image is rendered from Markdown. This support
        allows you to extend the default image render hook without replacing it. You can still
        [define additional image render hooks][01] on a per-output-format basis, like a custom image
        output for content in an RSS feed.
        
        In Platen, image render hook partials registered by features are processed one at a time for
        each enabled feature with a defined image render hook partial until one of them returns a
        non-empty string representing the rendered content.

        If no image render hook partial returns a rendered string, the default image render hook is
        called instead. The first image render hook partial to return a non-empty string ends the
        render hook processing. Any remaining render hook partials are never processed for that
        image.

        A feature can only define one image render hook partial.

        If specified, this partial is processed when a link is rendered from Markdown. This support
        allows you to extend the default link render hook without replacing it. You can still
        [define additional link render hooks][01] on a per-output-format basis, like a custom link
        output for content in an RSS feed.
        
        In Platen, link render hook partials registered by features are processed one at a time for
