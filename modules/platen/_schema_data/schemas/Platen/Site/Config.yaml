        Defines the configuration for shortcodes that integrate with Platen.

        While you can add shortcodes independently of this configuration, the setting provides a
        standardized and discoverable way for theme developers building on Platen to make their
        shortcodes usable for others without requiring modifying the base theme's files.

        Platen modules use this configuration to add their shortcodes and make them configurable.

        Shortcodes defined in this way must not depend on each other.

  markup:

    description: Configure custom markdown for Platen.
    schematize:
      details: |
        Platen site and theme developers sometimes need to override how codeblocks, images, links, and
        headers are rendered into HTML for a page. These settings allow developers to add new syntax
        for converting Markdown into HTML in a standard, discoverable, configurable way. This makes
        the new syntax usable for others without requiring modifying the base theme's files.

        Platen modules use this configuration to extend the available markup options. Markup options
        added this way must not depend on each other.

        For more information on defining a markup option, see [Defining Markup Renderers][01] in the
        [Theme Guide][02].
