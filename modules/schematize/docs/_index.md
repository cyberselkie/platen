Schematize provides helpers for publishing and documenting JSON schemas. It's used to provide the
documentation on this site for the various configuration options and can be used by other theme
developers and anyone publishing data structures for others to use.

It includes functionality for publishing JSON schemas from YAML, rendering documentation pages for
JSON schemas, and referencing both schemas and external documentation.
