{{/*
  Writes the examples section for an object with a heading followed by a series of code blocks
  showing valid values for this object.

  This partial uses the parameters from the object's own documentation partial. The parameters are
  expected to include:

  - `property` - Mandatory. The objects's schema data
  - `page`     - Mandatory. The hugo Page object for the webpage the documentation is being written
    on, for resolving references.
  - `_level` - Optional. The current hierarchy level of the page. Used for determining what heading
    level to write. If unspecified, it's assumed that this is a top-level object, documenting a full
    schema.
  - `_id` - Optional. The ID this property belongs to. If specified, used as the prefix for this
    object's properties. This value should be null for a top-level object and set for any nested
    objects, like properties of a top-level object.
