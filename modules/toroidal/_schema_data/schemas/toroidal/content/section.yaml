description: Optional settings for the Toroidal module on a section page.

  details: |
    Defines optional settings for the Toroidal module on a section (`_index.md`) page using values
    in the page's front matter.

    This is largely only useful for defining defaults for the webring through Hugo's [`cascade`][01]
    feature, allowing you to define the values once at the section level and override or extend
    them for members as needed.

        Specifies values to apply to pages in this section by default. If a page also defines one of
        these settings, the value in the page's frontmatter overrides any set here at the section
        level. Values for this setting override any set in the site configuration.

            Specifies the name of the webring. If this value isn't specified, the default name
            `Webring` is used.

            This setting overrides the [sref:`toroidal.webring_name`][s01] in the site's
            configuration. You can override this setting on a per-member basis by setting
            [sref:`toroidal_webring_name`][s02] in the member page's front matter.

            Specifies whether the navigation for a member should include a link to a random member
            of the webring. Set this value to `true` to enable the random member link and `false` to
            disable it. The default is `true`.
            
            This setting overrides the [sref:`toroidal.random_member_link`][s01] in the site's
            configuration. You can override this setting on a per-member basis by setting
            [sref:`toroidal_random_member_link`][s02] in the member page's front matter.

          details: |
            Specifies one or more classes to append to the generated HTML for the webring. To
            specify multiple classes, separate each class with a space. You can use this value with
            the defined themes to style a webring more specifically.

            This setting overrides the [sref:`toroidal.class`][s01] in the site's configuration. You
            can override this setting on a per-member basis by setting [sref:`toroidal_class`][s02]
            in the member page's front matter.

          details: |
            This setting specifies whether to hide the `h2` element on member pages. By default,
            every member page includes the webring's name as an `h2` at the top of the member's
            navigation. Set this value to `true` to hide the element on member pages for this
            webring.
            
            This setting overrides the [sref:`toroidal.hide_header`][s01] in the site's

            [sref:`toroidal_hide_header`][s02] in the member page's front matter.
