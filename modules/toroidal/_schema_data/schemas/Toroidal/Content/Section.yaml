title: Section Front Matter
description: Optional settings for the Toroidal module on a section page.
schematize:
  details: |
    Defines optional settings for the Toroidal module on a section (`_index.md`) page using values
    in the page's front matter.

    This is largely only useful for defining defaults for the webring through Hugo's `cascade`
    feature, allowing you to define the values once at the section level and override or extend
    them for members as needed.

      details: |
        Specifies values to apply to pages in this section by default. If a page also defines one of
        these settings, the value in the page's frontmatter overrides any set here at the section
        level. Values for this setting override any set in the site configuration.

      ToroidalWebringName:
        title: Webring Name
        description: Specifies the name of the webring
        schematize:
          weight: 1
          details: |
            Specifies the name of the webring. This setting can be defined at the site, webring, and
            member level, with the webring overriding the site and the member overriding both. If this
            value isn't specified, the default name `Webring` is used.
        type: string
      ToroidalRandomMemberLink:
        title: Display Random Member
        description: Whether the navigation for a member should include a link to a random member
        schematize:
          weight: 2
          details: |
            Specifies whether the navigation for a member should include a link to a random member of
            the webring. This setting can be defined at the site, webring, and member level, with the
            webring overriding the site and the member overriding both.

            Set this value to `true` to enable the random member link and `false` to disable it. The
            default is `true`.
        type: boolean
        default: true
      ToroidalClass:
        title: Additional Class
        description: Specifies one or more classes to append to the generated HTML for the webring
        schematize:
          weight: 3
          details: |
            Specifies one or more classes to append to the generated HTML for the webring. To specify
            multiple classes, separate each class with a space. You can use this value with the defined
            themes to style a webring more specifically.
        type: string
        default: ""
      ToroidalHideHeader:
        title: Hide Header on Member Pages
        description: Specifies whether to hide the h2 header on member pages in this webring
        schematize:
          weight: 4
          details: |
            This setting specifies whether to hide the `h2` element on member pages. By default,
            every member page includes the webring's name as an `h2` at the top of the member's
            navigation.

            Set this value to `true` to hide the element on member pages for this webring. This
            setting overrides the [sref`Toroidal.HideHeader`] in the site's configuration. You can
            override this setting on a per-member basis by setting [sref:`ToroidalHideHeader`] in
            the member page's front matter.
        type: boolean
        default: false
